##Embed Github Gists
=====================================
A Chrome Extension that lets you easily embed files from a github repository like a gist from a context menu.

##Installation
=====================================
1. Download the file called ['Embed Github Gists.crx'](https://github.com/ishu3101/Embed-Github-Gists/raw/master/Embed Github Gists.crx)
2. Open "Extensions" page from **Wrench->Tools->Extensions** or by typing **chrome://extensions/** in the address bar in Google Chrome.
3. Drag the downloaded file into the extension page which you opened in the previous step.

**Note:** If you get the error message saying **'package is invalid: crx magic number invalid'** when installing the extension then make sure you are downloading the raw **['Embed Github Gists.crx'](https://github.com/ishu3101/Embed-Github-Gists/raw/master/Embed Github Gists.crx)** file which Githhub does not download when you download by right clicking and selecting **'Save link as'** from the source code directory.

##Usage
=====================================
1. Visit the github repository page where the file is located.
2. Right Click on the file link which you would like to embed in your website.
3. Click on **Get Embed Gist URL**
4. The Embeded Github Gist URL has been copied onto the clipboard.

**Note: The context menu is only shown when you right click on the links on pages which begin with https://github.com/**
